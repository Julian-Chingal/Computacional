00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
This is a wood saw, but what would happen if, by accident, you touched it?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,040
Well, most wood saws have a protective device to save your finger or hand,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
and it's really impressive how it works.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,120
The saw blade transmits a small electrical signal.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,800
When the skin comes into contact with the blade, the signal changes because the human body is a driver.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,040
The signal change activates the security system, which activates the brake.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,680
At this moment, a high aluminum brake, the spinning stick, stops it in less than 5 milliseconds.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,000
Then, the blade pushes under the table, eliminating the risk of subsequent contact,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,880
and the engine is cut off.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,880
And in the process, saving your finger.
