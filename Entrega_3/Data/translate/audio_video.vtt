This is a wood saw, but what would happen if, by accident, you touched it?

00:03.880 --> 00:09.040
Well, most wood saws have a protective device to save your finger or hand,

00:09.040 --> 00:11.280
and it's really impressive how it works.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.120
The saw blade transmits a small electrical signal.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.800
When the skin comes into contact with the blade, the signal changes because the human body is a driver.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.040
The signal change activates the security system, which activates the brake.

00:22.040 --> 00:27.680
At this moment, a high aluminum brake, the spinning stick, stops it in less than 5 milliseconds.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.000
Then, the blade pushes under the table, eliminating the risk of subsequent contact,

00:32.000 --> 00:33.880
and the engine is cut off.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.880
And in the process, saving your finger.
