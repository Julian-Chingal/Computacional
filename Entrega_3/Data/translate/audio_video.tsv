0	3880	This is a wood saw, but what would happen if, by accident, you touched it?
3880	9040	Well, most wood saws have a protective device to save your finger or hand,
9040	11280	and it's really impressive how it works.
11280	14120	The saw blade transmits a small electrical signal.
14120	18800	When the skin comes into contact with the blade, the signal changes because the human body is a driver.
18800	22040	The signal change activates the security system, which activates the brake.
22040	27680	At this moment, a high aluminum brake, the spinning stick, stops it in less than 5 milliseconds.
27720	32000	Then, the blade pushes under the table, eliminating the risk of subsequent contact,
32000	33880	and the engine is cut off.
33880	35880	And in the process, saving your finger.
